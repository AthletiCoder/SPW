    "## 0 The Beginning\n",
    "> _\"Python was conceived in the late 1980s by **Guido van Rossum** at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.....\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "### And the rest is history\n",
    "> _\"Python has reached its highest rating ever in the monthly Tiobe index of programming language popularity. On its current trajectory, Tiobe noted, Python could leapfrog Java and C in the next three or four years to become the index’s most-popular language.\"_\n",

    "### 1.1 Wikipedia\n",
    "> _\"Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, **general-purpose** programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and **object-oriented** approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Python is **dynamically typed** and **garbage-collected**. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including **procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming**. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Interpreted**\n",
    "A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also referred to as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++. Compilation includes optimisation and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](resources/c-compilation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compiler and interpreter both are intended to do the same work but differ in operating procedure, Compiler takes source code in an aggregated way whereas Interpreter takes constituent parts of source code, i.e., statement by statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **High-level**\n",
    "A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as Python, C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](resources/hll.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **General-purpose**\n",
    "No fixed domain of application, unlike domain-specific languages which are designed for a particular use-case.\n",
    "For example, HTML, CSS are Domain specific languages \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Object-oriented**\n",
    "A programming paradigm, a design strategy, for aesthetic purposes (some times). More on this later\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Procedural**\n",
    "Execution done the usual control-flow items - functions, conditional statements, loops, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Functional programming**\n",
    "Considers functions as first class citizens - can assign them to a variable, pass them as function arguments.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def method1():\n",
    "    return 'hello world'\n",
    "\n",
    "def method2(methodToRun):\n",
    "    result = methodToRun()\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "method2(method1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Dynamically typed**\n",
    "Need not define the type while declaring a variable. More importantly, the variable type is not fixed\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include<iostream>\n",
    "#include<string>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Garbage collected**\n",
    "Python’s memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic. The user does not have to preallocate or deallocate memory similar to using dynamic memory allocation in languages such as C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "No more pointers!   \n",
    "No more new, delete!  \n",
    "\n",
