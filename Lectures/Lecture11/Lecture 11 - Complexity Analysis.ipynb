    "\n",
    "But can we actually find out the execution time just by looking at the code? Therefore, this model makes certain assumptions (reasonable ones) which help simplifying things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "* Instructions are executed one after another. No concurrent operations - No multi-process/multi-core execution\n",
    "* It’s too tedious to define each of the instructions and their associated time costs\n",
    "* Therefore we assume that few of the instructions take fixed amount of time - theoretically\n",
    "    * Arithmetic: add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, floor, ceiling). Also, shift left/shift right (good for multiplying/dividing by 2k ).\n",
    "    * Data movement: load, store, copy.\n",
    "    * Control: conditional/unconditional branch, subroutine call and return.\n",
    "* This model is also oblivious to the data type precision\n",
    "    * Usually arithmetic operations vary a lot in time/memory with precision of the data type"

    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "* The time taken by an algorithm depends on the input to the code because that's the only variable\n",
    "* Searching a number from 1000 numbers takes longer than finding it from 3 numbers\n",
    "* A given search algorithm may even take differing amounts of time on two inputs of the same size\n",
    "* For example, we’ll see that linear sort takes less time to sort n elements when they are already sorted than when they are jumbled\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input size\n",
    "* Depends on the problem being studied.\n",
    "* Usually, the number of items in the input. Like the size n of the array being queried for search\n",
    "* But could be something else. If multiplying two integers, could be the total number of bits in the two integers. Could be described by more than one number. \n",
    "    * For example, if a program requires two loops, of different size, one inside another like the following\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        # do something\n",

    "* Want to define steps to be machine-independent\n",
    "* Figure that each line of pseudocode requires a constant amount of time.\n",
    "* One line may take a different amount of time than another, but each execution of line i takes the same amount of time c<sub>i</sub>\n",
    "* This is assuming that the line consists only of primitive operations.\n",
    "    * If the line is a subroutine call, then the actual call takes constant time, but the execution of the subroutine being called might not.\n",
    "    * If the line specifies operations other than primitive ones, then it might take more than constant time. Example: “sort the points by x-coordinate.”\n",
