Hello again. This is the third video in my series that I ended up
calling kivy crash course.

In this video, I'm going to add some more functionality to the simple
kivy app I made in part 1, and displayed again here. If you remember,
we have this text 'Hello!' displayed with a kivy label widget, which
in turn we can move around because it's placed in a kivy scatter
widget that knows how to interpret all this kind of behaviour.

Going back to the python, this is exactly the code I wrote in part
1. You can copy it down now if you want to follow along, or I'll put a
link to a downloadable version in the video description.

Now, how are we going to change the app?
Specifically,
instead of just saying 'hello!' I want to let the user input some text
to display. This'll demonstrate a few more kivy widgets including one
for text input, as well as how to bind behaviour between widgets.

...start with demo


...write textinput part


...show again

...set orientation, binding

...show final
