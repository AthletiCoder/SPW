    "> _\"Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, **general-purpose** programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and **object-oriented** approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects\" </br>\n",
    "\"Python is **dynamically typed** and **garbage-collected**. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including **procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming**. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\"_ </br>\n",

    "##### **Interpreted**\n",
    "A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also referred to as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++. Compilation includes optimisation and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab.\n",
