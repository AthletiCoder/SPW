1. Write a Python program which accepts complex number input in the form 'a+bj' and prints the real and imaginary part of it.
Sample input: 10.453+777j
Expected output : Real part is 10.453 and Imaginary part is 777j 

(Hint: string functions)

2. Run the following statements,
print(True and True)
print(True and False)
print(True and 0)
print(True and 1)
print(False and True)
print(0 and True)
print(1 and True)
print(1 and 5)
