Note: Try to solve the following questions on your own. Do not worry about the neatness, efficiency, etc of your solution in the first attempt.  

1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format.
Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are" Output :

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are! 
		Up above the world so high,   		
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are

(Hint: explore \n and \t for print())

2. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.

3. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn. 
Sample value of n is 5
Expected Result : 615 (i.e. 5+55+555)
