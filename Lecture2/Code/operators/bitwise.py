a = 5
b = 6
print(a & b) # bit by bit AND operation
print(a | b) # bit by bit OR operation
print(a ^ b) # bit by bit XOR operation
print(~a) # complement a, machine reads as 2's complement
print(a << b) # left-shift operation, shifting by 1 is equal to multiply by 2
print(a >> b) # right-shift operation, shifting by 1 is equal to divide by 2
